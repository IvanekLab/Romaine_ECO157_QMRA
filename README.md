**E. Bulut, S. I. Murphy, L. K. Strawn, M. D. Danyluk, M. Wiedmann & R. Ivanek. 2024. Risk assessment of *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 along the farm-to-fork fresh-cut romaine lettuce supply chain. (In preparation)**

We introduce a comprehensive QMRA framework along the farm-to-fork fresh-cut romaine supply chain, including a novel preharvest difference equation model, to predict annual *Escherichia coli* O157:H7  illness cases in the United States and evaluate control strategies. We include two spradsheets for analysis described in the study:

- "LettuceQMRA_v136_Preharvest.xlsx" file includes the preharvest model.
- "Lettuce QMRA_v108_Postharvest.xlsx" file includes the postharvest model.
